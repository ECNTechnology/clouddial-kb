# Contacts

## Do Not Call Register

Cloud Dial maintains a user-defined 'Do Not Call Register', which can be added to in two ways.

* When completing a call, an agent can elect to add the contact to the Do Not Call Register.
* A Manager can manually ad a contact to the Do Not Call Register.

From the '**Contacts**' menu on the left-hand side of the screen, select '**Do Not Call Register**'.

Use the search bar to search for and locate specific contacts/numbers.

The column headings provide detailed information about each contact on the Do Not Call Register.

* **Name:** The name of the contact.
* **Phone:** The phone number that should not be dialled.
* **Created By:** The person who added the contact to the Do Not Call Register.
* **Created:** The date/time the contact was added to the Do Not Call Register.

## Manage Contacts

'Manage Contacts' allows you to search, review, and update individual contacts within a NEW or RUNNING campaign.

From the '**Contacts**' menu on the left-hand side of the screen, select '**Manage Contacts**'.
