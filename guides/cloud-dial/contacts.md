## Do Not Call Register

Cloud Dial maintains a user-defined 'Do Not Call Register', which can be added to in two ways.

* When completing a call, an agent can elect to add the contact to the Do Not Call Register.

* A Manager can manually ad a contact to the Do Not Call Register.

From the '**Contacts**' menu on the left-hand side of the screen, select '**Do Not Call Register**'.
