# Call Recordings

::: tip
**New Feature:** In order to meet PCIDSS Compliance, we have enhanced the call recording functionality to enable an Agent to '**mute**' a recording while taking payment or other personal information.
:::

While an Agent is on an active call, they will be offered the following call recording options:
### Recording Options
