# Frequently Asked Questions

## Logging shows high number of failed calls.

One possible cause of a high number of failed calls can be caused by croud sourced applications such as Truecaller and Hiya. 
These applications can mark a call as a 'Telemarketer' and in extreme cases, can even hide the call from the user.

Hiya is installed by default on many Android phones.


**Example:**

::: tip
If you find your number has been marked in such a fashion, it might be time to use a new outbound caller ID.
