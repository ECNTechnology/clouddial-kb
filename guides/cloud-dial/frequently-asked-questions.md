# Frequently Asked Questions

## Logging shows high number of failed calls.

One possible cause of a high number of failed calls can be caused by croud sourced applications such as Truecaller and Hiya. 
These applications can mark a call as a 'Telemarketer' and in extreme cases, can even hide the call from the user.

Hiya is installed by default on many Android phones.

If you find your number has been marked in such a fashion, it might be time to use a new outbound caller ID.
