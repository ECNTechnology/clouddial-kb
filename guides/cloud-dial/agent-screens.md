While on any call, an Agent will be looking at the above screen.

There is a lot more information readily available on this page so we will cover it off in sections.

## Messages and Callbacks

In the top right hand corner of the page you can see your '**Username**', your '**Messages**', and the '**Logout**' button.

In this table you can see the following information:

  * **OnBreak:** Typically used while having lunch, or for bathroom breaks.
  * **Ready:** While waiting for the next call, you are in 'Ready' status.
  * **WrapUp:** 'WrapUp' status refers to the time bTo leave a pre-recorded message, click 
etween ending a call, and selecting 'Ready' to take the next call.
* **My Total Time:** This column displays the total time you have spent in each status.
* **My Avg. Time:** This is the average time you have spent in each status.
* **Campaign Avg. Time %:** This is the average time that all agents have spent in each status.

## Inbound Calls Search Function

In the event of an inbound call to a <a href="https://kb.clouddial.com.au/guides/cloud-dial/management.html#general-campaigns">Blended Campaign</a> there is a possibility of an inbound call from a 'non-recognised' number that is not associated with any contact on a campaign.

In this instance Cloud Dial will offer the option to search and link the call to an existing contact.

<img style="width: 500px; height: auto;" src="/images/clouddial_search_1.png">

Use the search option to locate the contact you wish to link to, then click click <img style="width: auto; height: 25px;" src="/images/clouddial_search_link.png">
