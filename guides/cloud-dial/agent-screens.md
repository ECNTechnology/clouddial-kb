While on any call, an Agent will be looking at the above screen.

There is a lot more information readily available on this page so we will cover it off in sections.

## Messages and Callbacks

In the top right hand corner of the page you can see your '**Username**', your '**Messages**', and the '**Logout**' button.

## Agent Statistics

As an agent, you can quickly see a table of information comparing your stats as an agent against the averages of the other agents.

In this table you can see the following information:

* **Status:** 

  * **OnBreak:** Typically used while having lunch, or for bathroom breaks.

  * **Ready:** While waiting for the next call, you are in 'Ready' status.

  * **WrapUp:** 'WrapUp' status refers to the time between ending a call, and selecting 'Ready' to take the next call.


* **My Total Time:** This column displays the total time you have spent in each status.

* **My Avg. Time:** This is the average time you have spent in each status.

* **Campaign Avg. Time %:** This is the average time that all agents have spent in each status.
