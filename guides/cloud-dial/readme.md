## Custom Dialling Order

Based on customer feedback we have added the ability to choose the order in which the numbers in your campaigns are dialled.

To start you will need to add a column to your campaign list in the numerical order you wish to dial the numbers.

Once you have your contact list created, you can create your new campaign.

On this screen you must enter the following information:
* **Campaign Name:** This is for your reference. (Your Agents will see this when they join campaigns).
* **Country:** Choose your country.
* **Dialling Prefix:** This will be your caller ID for your outbound calls.
* **Redial Attempts:** This determines how many times CloudDial will dial the number before giving up.
* **Power Factor:** The number of simultaneous calls dialled in relation as a ratio to the number of active agents on your campaign.
* **Select Contacts:** Use the '**Select**' to upload your CloudDial campaign data.

Click '**Next**' when complete.
