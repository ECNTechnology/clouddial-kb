## Direct or Trunk Mode?

There are a few fundamental differences between **Direct Mode** and **Trunk Mode**.

**Direct Mode** is designed for a **_single endpoint_** such as an Analog Telephone Adapter (*ATA*) or an IP Phone.

**Trunk Mode** is designed to be used with a PBX system, either hardware based such as an NEC SL1100 or a software based solution, such as FusionPBX.
